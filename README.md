# Catalogue Data Ingestion
## *Challenge 1 of WebValley 2024*

This repository contains different branches.

- '**main**' contains just this README.md file.
- '**scripts**' contains the scripts used to download the data from the catalogue and elaborate it.
- '**webapp**' contains the Django web application that uses the data elaborated by the scripts and displays it in a user-friendly way.
  - A copy of the '***scripts***' branch is also present in the '***webapp***' branch, to allow the web application to run the scripts.
